# Cucumber Statistics

### Work in progress

A cucumber formatter that will gather statistics and generate a single page showing step time metrics.

Work in progress: the intent is to provide a way to hook this in and always generate the file, as well as us it as a standard formatter.

To use as a formatter: cucumber --format CucumberStatistics::Formatter

Look in the `./tmp/cucumber_statistics` for the generated html documents.
